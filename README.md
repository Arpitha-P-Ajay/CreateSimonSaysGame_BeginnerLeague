### Beginner's League

# Challenge - Create Simon Says Game
Create a memory game where four colored buttons light up in a specific pattern. After the pattern is displayed, the player must repeat it by clicking the buttons in the correct order. Every time the player completes the pattern, the game increases the length of the pattern. If the player clicks the wrong button, the game ends.

Here i tried gradient effect for each boxes, text shadows in CSS. JavaScript part was referred from youtube and other repos.
